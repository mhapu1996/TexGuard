It monitor our daily activity and send messages to our friends & family if we are in a danger . 
and it will analysis data from using satellite information from 3-4 hours to ten minutes or less.
In our day to day life a mischief can happen to us at any time and any place.
In most of the situation we can’t get the help we need in time as we can’t communicate with others. 
Because when a person is abducted, all sorts of communicating device are taken away from him. But the APP which will install in
your friends & families phone will track you by the help of a tinny device inserted in your clothing.
The device will stay hidden underneath the fabric and will not be visible from outside.
